## VISUALIZATION & ANALYSIS 

### STEP 1

First we study the data properly by give a sufficient time on it.

### STEP 2

Than we calculat KPIs 

#### Calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- <u> Total Loan Application </u> <br>

- <u> Total Amount Received </u> <br>
- <u> Average Intrest Rate </u> <br>
- <u> Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) </u> <br>

### STEP 4

Than we visualiza a data by using different chart and we play around it to get some insight from it.

#### Visualize Data Through Various Charts:

- <u> Stacked bar chart </u> = Hourly Trend for Total Pizzas Sold <br>
- <u> Line chart </u> = Weekly Trend for Total Orders <br>
- <u> Pie chart </u> = Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category <br>
- <u> Pie chart </u> = Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size <br>
- <u> Funnel chart </u> = Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category <br>

- <u> Top 5 pizza by quntity </u>  <br>
- <u> Top 5 pizza by total order </u>  <br>

#### Monthly:
Maximum Orders Are Placed in July and January : <br> 
These months show a significant spike in orders, possibly due to holidays and seasonal promotions. <br>
Implication : Seasonal marketing campaigns and promotions can be strategically planned for these months to capitalize on the increased customer demand.
